### Guidelines for Participants:
1. You initiate the hackathon by forking the Git repository given by GenAIVersity, which
contains instructions and guidelines for the event.

2. Your initial change must involve updating the README.md file to include a
comprehensive problem statement and solution description.

3. You are required to exhibit the implementation of solutions in the domains of
Generative AI (ChatBots, RAG, Agents, and Agentic AI) and Machine Learning
technologies utilizing Python, JavaScript, or TypeScript.

4. You must possess foundational knowledge of Machine Learning principles, LLM
parameters, embeddings, prompt engineering, context engineering, RAG, agents,
agentic AI, MCP, LangChain, ChromaDB, and token generation.

5. It is beneficial to possess understanding regarding Guardrails and Evaluations which
has additional weightage for evaluation.

6. If you are utilizing local LLMS, ensure they are downloaded and prepared prior to the
hackathon, since they require significant internet bandwidth. If employing external APIs
such as OpenAI, Gemini, or Anthropic, you must provide your API key,
as GenAIVersity does not supply one.

7. You are permitted to utilize Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity,
and coding tools like Copilot and Cursor; however, you must retain conversation history
and safeguard it from deletion.

8. Select a problem statement from any domain, preferably: a) Education b) Finance c)
Healthcare d) Telecom e) Productivity f) Technological Innovation. Sample problems are
included in the attached document for your comprehension; you may select and adapt
the ideas presented.

9. It's nice to have the user interface(UI/Frontend), but it doesn't help with review much
because managing time during a hackathon is very important.


### Assessment Standards
1. 25% Innovation
2. 25% Technical Implementation
3. 25% Utilization of Artificial Intelligence
4. 15% Impact and Expandability
5. 10% Presentation

### Submission Checklist
- Updated README.md (problem, data link, design, assumptions).
- Reproducible Notebook(s) and/or minimal FastAPI service (no UI required).
- requirements.txt / environment.yml and run commands.
- Evaluation notes (metrics, tests, guardrails, limitations).
- Commit history & AI chat logs (attach/export or link).

## VERY IMP NOTE: A 10min demonstration video has to be screen recorded with your voice and should be shared through YouTube link.
