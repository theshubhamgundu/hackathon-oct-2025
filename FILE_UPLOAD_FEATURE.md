extractTextFromFile() processes file
    â†“
API call to /analyze-document
    â†“
System instructions displayed in chat
```

### Backend Flow:
```
POST /analyze-document
    â†“
Authentication check
    â†“
generateSystemInstructions()
    â”œâ”€ Document classification
    â”œâ”€ extractKeyTopics()
